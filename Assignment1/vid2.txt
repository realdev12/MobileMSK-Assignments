This video taught scripting in linux
creation of .sh files, editing using nano editor
Also giving permission to the files using chmod command (r,x permission)
It was also shown how to write shell bullitin commands, variables, comments
These were new concepts for me as they were not covered pervioulsly in our courses.
I used UBUNTU to follow the video and execute the commands
